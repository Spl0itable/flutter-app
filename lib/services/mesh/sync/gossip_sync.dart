// gossip_sync.dart - Gossip-synced public history.
//
// The controlled flood delivers a public message to whoever is in radio range
// AT THAT MOMENT. Walk into the room a minute late, or come back after the
// crowd has split into two partitions that never touched, and that message is
// simply gone — the mesh has no memory. This is the memory: every device keeps
// a bounded window of recent public packets and periodically reconciles it with
// its neighbours, so a phone that moves between partitions (or relaunches
// hours later) serves the backlog to whoever missed it.
//
// The reconciliation is bitchat's, wire-for-wire, so a Nymchat device and a
// bitchat device sync each other's history rather than each holding half of it:
// a REQUEST_SYNC ([RequestSyncPacket]) carries a Golomb-Coded Set of the ids
// the sender already holds, and the receiver replies with whatever falls
// outside it. See `gcs_filter.dart` for why a GCS rather than a list of ids.
//
// Everything here is pure: the store is in memory, the diff is a function of
// (store, request), and IO belongs to [MeshService], which owns the radio. That
// is what lets the interesting parts — freshness, eviction, the diff, the
// since-cursor — be tested without a Bluetooth stack.
