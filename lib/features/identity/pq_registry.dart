/// Hybrid post-quantum key announcement, discovery, and policy, ported 1:1 from
/// the PWA's `js/modules/pq.js`.
///
/// The crypto lives in `lib/core/crypto/pq.dart`; this file decides WHO gets it.
///
/// ## Discovery
/// Each client publishes its ML-KEM-768 public key as a signed, replaceable
/// kind-30078 bundle (`['d','nym-pq'],['t','nym-pq']`), the same machinery the
/// `nym-vouches` web of trust already uses. Holding a peer's valid announcement
/// IS the negotiation: there is no in-band capability exchange, so there is no
/// downgrade surface. Peers without one — Bitchat users, other Nostr clients,
/// older Nymchat builds — keep receiving classical NIP-17 unchanged.
///
/// ## Why the key derives from the nsec
/// ML-KEM keygen is a pure function of a 64-byte seed, so deriving that seed
/// from the identity key means every device sharing an nsec derives the SAME
/// ML-KEM key. That is what makes one replaceable announcement per identity
/// correct — two devices can never fight over it — and there is no new secret
/// to back up.
///
/// ## Why it is opt-in
/// A post-quantum wrap is readable only by a build that has ML-KEM. Sending a
/// classical copy alongside would defeat the point entirely (an attacker just
/// breaks the classical copy), so enabling is necessarily all-or-nothing per
/// identity. An older device on the same nsec cannot be detected — it publishes
/// no announcement — so the switch is an explicit, informed choice. Fresh
/// installs default on; upgrades default off.
///
/// Socket-free and UI-free so the ingest, expiry and policy rules are
/// unit-testable in isolation (mirrors `trust_graph.dart`).
