// A sent message must carry its own encryption state immediately.
//
// The optimistic echo goes on screen before the send path has looked up the
// recipient's key, and nothing wrote the answer back onto it. So an own message
// read as classical until our SELF-copy round-tripped through the relays and
// was unwrapped -- or, if it never did, until the app was restarted and the
// conversation reopened, which is when the archive re-unwraps it. The PWA sets
// this from the send plan, so only this client showed it.
